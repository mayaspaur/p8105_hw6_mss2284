```{r}
data = 
  read_csv(file = "./data/birthweight.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    babysex = as.factor(babysex),
    frace = as.factor(frace),
    mrace = as.factor(mrace)
  )

view(data)

summary(data)

```

There is missing data for the variables pnumlbw and pnumgsa.

Modeling process

```{r proposed model}
model = lm(bwt ~ fincome, data = data) %>%
  broom::tidy()

model
```

```{r main effects model}

main_effects = lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = data) %>%
  broom::tidy()
```

One using head circumference, length, sex, and all interactions (including the three-way interaction) between these
